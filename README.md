check_process_resources
=======================

Icinga / Nagios Plugin to monitor resource usage of processes

Introduction
------------

The first version of the plugin was taken from http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Operating-Systems/Linux/Check-Process-Resources/details and was written by Eli Keimig from http://www.ektechnologies.com/ and put under the GPL.

I put this up on github as a personal project because it lacks the quality and support I want for an official Project at https://www.netways.org/ . Whenever I put some work into it for a Netways project, I will use my other email address for commits. You can find this project at https://github.com/widhalmt/check_process_resources

I see quite a few chances for improvement in the original script and I hope it will not take long before I can fix most of them even though this is a "low priority" project. I will keep the ToDo list as issues on GitHub.
